              Router is a five port gigabit ethernet Router for locations where
          wireless connectivity is not required. The device has a USB 2.0 port
          and a SFP port for adding optical fiber connectivity. The ports 2-5
          can power other PoE capable devices with the same voltage as applied
          to the unit. It is affordable, small and easy to use, but at the same
          time comes with a very powerful 800MHz CPU, capable of all the
          advanced configurations that RouterOS supports. Less power adapters
          and cables to worry about! Max current is 1A per port if input voltage
          is 12-30V, 450mA if 31-57V, Ethernet ports are shielded. RB960PGS can
          power 802.3af/at devices if 48V DC input is used (unit comes with 24v
          power supply, so you would have to purchase 48v power supply
          separately to support this). Unit provides max current 450mA for each
          port regardless device power class (doesnâ€™t support PoE powered device
          classification).
